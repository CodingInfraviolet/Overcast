# Overcast
An Opengl 4 game engine.

My earlier game engine, parts of which I took to build Fury.
It has deferred rendering, and relies on a number of third party libraries.
It has a built-in model file coverter based on Assimp, and automatically
converts any models in the Game/Models folder to the internal vmf format.
